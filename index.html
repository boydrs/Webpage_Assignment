<h1>About Myself</h1>
<p> My Name is Ryan B, and I would like to tell you a little bit about myself. <br> My hometown is in a western suburb of Chicago, Illinois. I am an editor for a TV show in The Discovery Channel. I am a freshman here at huntington, and I am majoring in <strong>film production.</strong> It's no suprise that I like film, but I have some other hobbies. They inclue:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Photography</li>
  <li>Unicycling</li>
  <li>Sound mixing</li>
  <li>Driving anything with an engine</li>
  </ul>
<p>While I am at Huntington Universtiy, I am focusing the most on film production. In fact, I just finished a short film project, called <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ab3PsEFdyww"><em>Finding Bones</em></a>. In this short film, the residents of Baker Second recount the dissapearance and rescue of the floor skeleton, Drake Bones. My role on the project was editor. While on set, I also ended up being the producer.</p>

<p>In addition to being editor, will be staring in the next short film that I will be a part of making. I will get to incorporate my other hobby of riding unicycles. The premise of the film is how riding a unicycle can make your day better. We will be shooting riding shots in the woods, which is my favorite place to ride my unicycle.</p>
