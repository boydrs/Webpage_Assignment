<h1>Incorporating My Faith With My Career</h1>
<p>Proverbs 16:3 says “Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and he will establish your plans.” As Christians, God calls us to integrate (or infuse) our faith into our vocation. My career goal as a digital media artist is to uniquely incorporate my faith. The most important aspect of integrating my faith with my career is bringing glory to God through my product and my interaction with my fellow crewmembers and others. Christians should be a light that shines toward Jesus and the gospel message. Being a light gives me opportunities to share the gospel, either through my product, or through social interactions. Related are the values that I want to practice in my career. They include hard work, learning, humility, honesty, respect, listening, patience, and selflessness. A few verses come to mind that reflect these values. They are Colossians 3:23 and Philippians 2:3. While not faith centered, there are a couple more values that I want to uphold in my career. The most important to me is storytelling. The other is a commitment to always learn. I want to avoid quitting, apathy, carelessness, and general behaviors that detract from bringing glory to God. Meshing my faith and career presents challenges that non-Christians might not experience. Christians are called to live in the world, but not of the world (John 17:16). This means that I will have to act in a Christ-like way. My lifestyle will make me stand out. There will be people who take offense to this, and may make having a relationship with them difficult. There might also be some job opportunities that I will have to decline if they are morally objectionable.<br>
These values matter most to me because I have seen them carried out by my boss. My boss (with whom I have worked in many different capacities, and consider a mentor) is one of the most humble and hardworking people I know. When teaching me, he is patient and kind. He listens to everybody, and makes them feel heard. Even though he is very knowledgeable in the field of digital media, he is always open to suggestions. He is always ready and happy to help, regardless of the task. As I move into my career as a digital media artist, I want to create the same types of environments that my boss creates. Ultimately, these values are important to me because, as a Christian, God calls me to live a life that reflects, and is glorifying to him. Meshing my faith and career shifts the focus of my career. It is no longer about me, my accomplishments and my products. It is about bringing glory to God, and creating environments and products point people to Christ.</p>
